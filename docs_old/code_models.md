# Code Models

## Blueprint

A blueprint is a fairly large class that must be subclassed to implement 
any new pairing of a particular layout in Obsidian to a particular layout in
Anki.

They will be conventionally named as `<Obsidian Layout Name>2<Anki Layout Name>`.

For example: `TaggedSides2Basic`.
