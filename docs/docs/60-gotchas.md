# âš  Gotchas

There are some gotchas that arise from the slightly fiddly nature of meshing Obsidian
and Anki together.

## Notes not updating when Note Browser is open

Due to a bug in Anki/AnkiConnect it isn't possible to update the deck in some instances
when the Note Browser is open.

See relevant discussion over at [AnkiConnect issue #82](https://github.com/FooSoft/anki-connect/issues/82)
