# Acknowledgement

While this project has evolved to share practically nothing with the excellent original
[Flashcards](https://github.com/reuseman/flashcards-obsidian) plugin
by [Alex Colucci](https://github.com/reuseman), it was originally a fork of it
and Alex's work on the Anki networking in particular was tremendously helpful.

It has also been inspired in purpose by the [Obsidian_to_Anki](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki)
project by [Rubaiyat Khondaker](https://github.com/Pseudonium).

Both of these projects are worthwhile alternatives to **AnkiBridge**
if the approach of this project isn't to your liking.
