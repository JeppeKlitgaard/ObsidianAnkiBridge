# üôè Support

Developing **AnkiBridge** was no small feat and it is (proudly) made available
free of charge.

If you want and are able to, you can throw a coffee or a coin my way on [Ko-fi]:

## üéÅ Showing your appreciation

While I definitely like to help out just for the sake of being nice, I also
get a nice fuzzy feeling when people return the favour by being nice in return.

This could simply be by being polite and appreciative on GitHub or Discord,
but throwing a fiver at me if I've helped you out also works.

## ‚ö† Disclaimer

I am fortunate enough to be able to work on projects like this without needing
them to put a roof over my head. Donations are not a necessity or even an expectation,
but they do mean a lot ‚Äì if not financially, then certainly morally!
